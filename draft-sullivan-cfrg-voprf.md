--- abstract

An Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) is a two-party protocol for computing
the output of a PRF. One party (the server) holds the PRF secret key, and the
other (the client) holds the PRF input. The 'obliviousness' property ensures
that the server does not learn anything about the client's input during the
evaluation. The client should also not learn anything about the server's secret
PRF key. Optionally, OPRFs can also satisfy a notion 'verifiability' (VOPRF). In
this setting, the client can verify that the server's output is indeed the
result of evaluating the underlying PRF with just a public key. This document
specifies OPRF and VOPRF constructions instantiated within prime-order groups,
including elliptic curves.

# Introduction

A pseudorandom function (PRF) F(k, x) is an efficiently computable function with
secret key k on input x. Roughly, F is pseudorandom if the output y = F(k, x) is
indistinguishable from uniformly sampling any element in F's range for random
choice of k. An oblivious PRF (OPRF) is a two-party protocol between a prover P
and verifier V where P holds a PRF key k and V holds some input x. The protocol
allows both parties to cooperate in computing F(k, x) with P's secret key k and
V's input x such that: V learns F(k, x) without learning anything about k; and P
does not learn anything about x. A Verifiable OPRF (VOPRF) is an OPRF wherein P
can prove to V that F(k, x) was computed using key k, which is bound to a
trusted public key Y = kG. Informally, this is done by presenting a
non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proof of equality between (G, Y) and (Z,
M), where Z = kM for some point M.

OPRFs have been shown to be useful for constructing: password-protected secret
sharing schemes {{JKK14}}; privacy-preserving password stores {{SJKS17}}; and
password-authenticated key exchange or PAKE {{OPAQUE}}. VOPRFs are useful for
producing tokens that are verifiable by V. This may be needed, for example, if V
wants assurance that P did not use a unique key in its computation, i.e., if V
wants key consistency from P. This property is necessary in some applications,
e.g., the Privacy Pass protocol {{PrivacyPass}}, wherein this VOPRF is used to
generate one-time authentication tokens to bypass CAPTCHA challenges. VOPRFs
have also been used for password-protected secret sharing schemes e.g.
{{JKKX16}}.

This document introduces an OPRF protocol built in prime-order groups, applying
to finite fields of prime-order and also elliptic curve (EC) settings. The
protocol has the option of being extended to a VOPRF with the addition of a NIZK
proof for proving discrete log equality relations. This proof demonstrates
correctness of the computation using a known public key that serves as a
commitment to the server's secret key. In the EC setting, we will refer to the
protocol as ECOPRF (or ECVOPRF if verifiability is concerned). The document
describes the protocol, its security properties, and provides preliminary test
vectors for experimentation. The rest of the document is structured as follows:

- Section {{background}}: Describe background, related work, and use cases of
  OPRF/VOPRF protocols.
- Section {{properties}}: Discuss security properties of OPRFs/VOPRFs.
- Section {{protocol}}: Specify an authentication protocol from OPRF
  functionality, based in prime-order groups (with an optional verifiable mode).
  Algorithms are stated formally for OPRFs in {{oprf}} and for VOPRFs in
  {{voprf}}.
- Section {{dleq}}: Specify the NIZK discrete logarithm equality (DLEQ)
  construction used for constructing the VOPRF protocol.
- Section {{batch}}: Specifies how the DLEQ proof mechanism can be batched for
  multiple VOPRF invocations, and how this changes the protocol execution.

# Background {#background}

OPRFs are functionally related to RSA-based blind signature schemes, e.g.,
{{ChaumBlindSignature}}. Briefly, a blind signature scheme works as follows. Let
m be a message to be signed by a server. It is assumed to be a member of the RSA
group. Also, let N be the RSA modulus, and e and d be the public and private
keys, respectively. A prover P and verifier V engage in the following protocol
given input m.

1. V generates a random blinding element r from the RSA group, and compute m' =
   m^r (mod N). Send m' to the P.
2. P uses m' to compute s' = (m')^d (mod N), and sends s' to the V.
3. V removes the blinding factor r to obtain the original signature as s =
   (s')^(r^-1) (mod N).

By the properties of RSA, s is clearly a valid signature for m. OPRF protocols
can be used to provide a symmetric equivalent to blind signatures. Essentially
the client learns y = PRF(k,x) for some input x of their choice, from a server
that holds k. Since the security of an OPRF means that x is hidden in the
interaction, then the client can later reveal x to the server along with y.

The server can verify that y is computed correctly by recomputing the PRF on x
using k. In doing so, the client provides knowledge of a 'signature' y for their
value x. However, the verification procedure is symmetric since it requires
knowledge of k. This is discussed more in the following section.

# Security Properties {#properties}

The security properties of an OPRF protocol with functionality y = F(k, x)
include those of a standard PRF. Specifically:

- Given value x, it is infeasible to compute y = F(k, x) without knowledge of k.
- The output distribution of y = F(k, x) is indistinguishable from the uniform
  distribution in the domain of the function F.

Additionally, we require the following additional properties:

- Non-malleable: Given (x, y = F(k, x)), V must not be able to generate (x', y')
  where x' != x and y' = F(k, x').
- Oblivious: P must learn nothing about V's input, and V must learn nothing
  about P's private key.
- Unlinkable: If V reveals x to P, P cannot link x to the protocol instance in
  which y = F(k, x) was computed.

Optionally, for any protocol that satisfies the above properties, there is an
additional security property:

- Verifiable: V must only complete execution of the protocol if it can
  successfully assert that P used its secret key k.

In practice, the notion of verifiability requires that P commits to the key k
before the actual protocol execution takes place. Then V verifies that P has
used k in the protocol using this commitment.

# OPRF Protocol {#protocol}

In this section we describe the OPRF protocol. Let GG be a prime-order additive
subgroup, with two distinct hash functions H_1 and H_2, where H_1 maps arbitrary
input onto GG and H_2 maps arbitrary input to a fixed-length output, e.g.,
SHA256. All hash functions in the protocol are modelled as random oracles. Let L
be the security parameter. Let k be the prover's (P) secret key, and Y = kG be
its corresponding 'public key' for some generator G taken from the group GG.
This public key is also referred to as a commitment to the key k. Let x be the
verifier's (V) input to the OPRF protocol. (Commonly, it is a random L-bit
string, though this is not required.)

The OPRF protocol begins with V blinding its input for the signer such that it
appears uniformly distributed GG. The latter then applies its secret key to the
blinded value and returns the result. To finish the computation, V then removes
its blind and hashes the result using H_2 to yield an output. This flow is
illustrated below.

~~~
     Verifier              Prover
  ------------------------------------
     r <-$ GG
     M = rH_1(x)
                   M
                ------->
                           Z = kM
                           [D = DLEQ_Generate(k,G,Y,M,Z)]
                  Z[,D]
                <-------
    [b = DLEQ_Verify(G,Y,M,Z,D)]
    N = Zr^(-1)
    Output H_2(x, N) [if b=1, else "error"]
~~~

Steps that are enclosed in square brackets (DLEQ_Generate and DLEQ_Verify) are
optional for achieving verifiability. These are described in Section {{dleq}}.
In the verifiable mode, we assume that P has previously committed to their
choice of key k with some values (G,Y=kG) and these are publicly known by V.
Notice that revealing (G,Y) does not reveal k by the well-known hardness of the
discrete log problem.

Strictly speaking, the actual PRF function that is computed is:

~~~
F(k, x) = N = kH_1(x)
~~~

It is clear that this is a PRF H_1(x) maps x to a random element in GG, and GG
is cyclic. This output is computed when the client computes Zr^(-1) by the
commutativity of the multiplication. The client finishes the computation by
outputting H_2(x,N). Note that the output from P is not the PRF value because
the actual input x is blinded by r.

This protocol may be decomposed into a series of steps, as described below:

- OPRF_Setup(l): Generate am integer k of sufficient bit-length l and output k.
- OPRF_Blind(x): Compute and return a blind, r, and blinded representation of x
  in GG, denoted M.
- OPRF_Sign(k,M): Sign input M using secret key k to produce Z.
- OPRF_Unblind(r,M,Z): Unblind blinded signature Z with blind r, yielding N and
  output N.
- OPRF_Finalize(x,N): Finalize N to produce the output H_2(x, N).

For verifiability we modify the algorithms of VOPRF_Setup, VOPRF_Sign and
VOPRF_Unblind to be the following:

- VOPRF_Setup(l): Generate am integer k of sufficient bit-length l and output
  (k, (G,Y)) where Y = kG for some generator G in GG.
- VOPRF_Sign(k,(G,Y),M): Sign input M using secret key k to produce Z. Generate
  a NIZK proof D = DLEQ_Generate(k,G,Y,M,Z), and output (Z, D).
- VOPRF_Unblind(r,G,Y,M,(Z,D)): Unblind blinded signature Z with blind r,
  yielding N. Output N if 1 = DLEQ_Verify(G,Y,M,Z,D). Otherwise, output "error".

We leave the rest of the OPRF algorithms unmodified. When referring explicitly
to VOPRF execution, we replace 'OPRF' in all method names with 'VOPRF'.

## Protocol correctness

Protocol correctness requires that, for any key k, input x, and (r, M) =
OPRF_Blind(x), it must be true that:

~~~
OPRF_Finalize(x, OPRF_Unblind(r,M,OPRF_Sign(k,M))) = H_2(x, F(k,x))
~~~

with overwhelming probability. Likewise, in the verifiable setting, we require
that:

~~~
VOPRF_Finalize(x, VOPRF_Unblind(r,G,Y,M,(VOPRF_Sign(k,M)))) = H_2(x, F(k,x))
~~~

with overwhelming probability, where (r, M) = VOPRF_Blind(x).

## Instantiations of GG

As we remarked above, GG is a subgroup with associated prime-order p. While we
choose to write operations in the setting where GG comes equipped with an
additive operation, we could also define the operations in the multiplicative
setting. In the multiplicative setting we can choose GG to be a prime-order
subgroup of a finite field FF_p. For example, let p be some large prime (e.g. >
2048 bits) where p = 2q+1 for some other prime q. Then the subgroup of squares
of FF_p (elements u^2 where u is an element of FF_p) is cyclic, and we can pick
a generator of this subgroup by picking g from FF_p (ignoring the identity
element).

For practicality of the protocol, it is preferable to focus on the cases where
GG is an additive subgroup so that we can instantiate the OPRF in the elliptic
curve setting. This amounts to choosing GG to be a prime-order subgroup of an
elliptic curve over base field GF(p) for prime p. There are also other settings
where GG is a prime-order subgroup of an elliptic curve over a base field of
non-prime order, these include the work of Ristretto {{RISTRETTO}} and Decaf
{{DECAF}}.

We will use p > 0 generally for constructing the base field GF(p), not just
those where p is prime. To reiterate, we focus only on the additive case, and so
we focus only on the cases where GF(p) is indeed the base field.

## OPRF algorithms {#oprf}

This section provides algorithms for each step in the OPRF protocol. We describe
the VOPRF analogues in {{voprf}}. We provide generic utility algorithms in
{{utils}}.

   interprets it as an integer.
2. V computes X = H_1(x) and a random element r (blinding factor) from GF(p),
   and computes M = rX.
3. V sends M to P.
4. P computes Z = kM = rkX.
5. In the elliptic curve setting, P multiplies Z by the cofactor (denoted h) of
   the elliptic curve.
6. P sends Z to V.
7. V unblinds Z to compute N = r^(-1)Z = kX.
8. V outputs the pair H_2(x, N).

## Efficiency gains with pre-processing and additive blinding

In the {{OPAQUE}} draft, it is noted that it may be more efficient to use
additive blinding rather than multiplicative if the client can preprocess some
values. For example, computing rH_1(x) is an example of multiplicative blinding.
A valid way of computing additive blinding would be to instead compute
H_1(x)+rG, where G is the common generator for the group.

If the client preprocesses values of the form rG, then computing H_1(x)+rG is
more efficient than computing rH_1(x) (one addition against log_2(r)).
Therefore, it may be advantageous to define the OPRF and VOPRF protocols using
additive blinding rather than multiplicative blinding. In fact the only
algorithms that need to change are OPRF_Blind and OPRF_Unblind (and similarly
for the VOPRF variants).

We define the additive blinding variants of the above algorithms below along
with a new algorithm OPRF_Preprocess that defines how preprocessing is carried
out. The equivalent algorithms for VOPRF are almost identical and so we do not
redefine them here. Notice that the only computation that changes is for V, the
necessary computation of P does not change.

### OPRF_Preprocess

Input:

 G: Public generator of GG

Output:

 r: Random scalar in [1, p-1]
 rG: An element in GG.
 rY: An element in GG.

Steps:

 1.  r <-$ GF(p)
 2.  Output (r, rG, rY)
~~~

### OPRF_Blind

~~~
Input:

 x: V's PRF input.
 rG: Preprocessed element of GG.

Output:

 M: Blinded representation of x using blind r, an element in GG.

Steps:

 1.  M := H_1(x)+rG
 2.  Output M
~~~

### OPRF_Unblind

~~~
Input:

 rY: Preprocessed element of GG.
 M: Blinded representation of x using rG, an element in GG.
 Z: An element in GG.

Output:

 N: Unblinded signature, element in GG.

Steps:

 1. N := Z-rY
 2. Output N
~~~

Notice that OPRF_Unblind computes (Z-rY) = k(H_1(x)+rG) - rkG = kH_1(x) by the
commutativity of scalar multiplication in GG. This is the same output as in the
original OPRF_Unblind algorithm.

# NIZK Discrete Logarithm Equality Proof {#dleq}

For the VOPRF protocol we require that V is able to verify that P has used its
private key k to evaluate the PRF. We can do this by showing that the original
commitment (G,Y) output by VOPRF_Setup(l) satisfies log_G(Y) == log_M(Z) where Z
is the output of VOPRF_Sign(k,M).

This may be used, for example, to ensure that P uses the same private key for
computing the VOPRF output and does not attempt to "tag" individual verifiers
with select keys. This proof must not reveal the P's long-term private key to V.

Consequently, this allows extending the OPRF protocol with a (non-interactive)
discrete logarithm equality (DLEQ) algorithm built on a Chaum-Pedersen
{{ChaumPedersen}} proof. This proof is divided into two procedures:
DLEQ_Generate and DLEQ_Verify. These are specified below.

## DLEQ_Generate

~~~
Input:

 k: Signer secret key.
 G: Public generator of GG.
 Y: Signer public key (= kG).
 M: An element in GG.
 Z: An element in GG.
 H_3: A hash function from GG to {0,1}^L, modelled as a random oracle.

Output:

 D: DLEQ proof (c, s).

Steps:

 1. r <-$ GF(p)
 2. A := rG and B := rM.
 3. c <- H_3(G,Y,M,Z,A,B)
 4. s := (r - ck) (mod p)
 5. Output D := (c, s)
~~~

## DLEQ_Verify

~~~
Input:

 G: Public generator of GG.
 Y: Signer public key.
 M: An element in GG.
 Z: An element in GG.
 D: DLEQ proof (c, s).

Output:

 True if log_G(Y) == log_M(Z), False otherwise.

Steps:

 1. A' := (sG + cY)
 2. B' := (sM + cZ)
 3. c' <- H_3(G,Y,M,Z,A',B')
 4. Output c == c'
~~~

# Batched VOPRF evaluation {#batch}

Common applications (e.g. {{PrivacyPass}}) require V to obtain multiple PRF
evaluations from P. In the VOPRF case, this would also require generation and
verification of a DLEQ proof for each Zi received by V. This is costly, both in
terms of computation and communication. To get around this, applications use a
'batching' procedure for generating and verifying DLEQ proofs for a finite
number of PRF evaluation pairs (Mi,Zi). For n PRF evaluations:

- Proof generation is slightly more expensive from 2n modular exponentiations to
  2n+2.
- Proof verification is much more efficient, from 4m modular exponentiations to
  2n+4.
- Communications falls from 2n to 2 group elements.

Therefore, since P is usually a powerful server, we can tolerate a slight
increase in proof generation complexity for much more efficient communication
and proof verification.

In this section, we describe algorithms for batching the DLEQ generation and
verification procedure. For these algorithms we require a pseudorandom generator
PRNG: {0,1}^a x ZZ -> ({0,1}^b)^n that takes a seed of length a and an integer n
as input, and outputs n elements in {0,1}^b.

## Batched DLEQ algorithms

### Batched_DLEQ_Generate

~~~
Input:

 k: Signer secret key.
 G: Public generator of group GG.
 Y: Signer public key (= kG).
 n: Number of PRF evaluations.
 [Mi]: An array of points in GG of length n.
 [Zi]: An array of points in GG of length n.
 PRNG: A pseudorandom generator of the form above.
 salt: An integer salt value for each PRNG invocation
 info: A string value for splitting the domain of the PRNG
 H_4: A hash function from GG^(2n+2) to {0,1}^a, modelled as a random oracle.

Output:

 D: DLEQ proof (c, s).

Steps:

 1. seed <- H_4(G,Y,[Mi,Zi]))
 2. d1,...dn <- PRNG(seed,salt,info,n)
 3. c1,...,cn := (int)d1,...,(int)dn
 4. M := c1M1 + ... + cnMn
 5. Z := c1Z1 + ... + cnZn
 6. Output D <- DLEQ_Generate(k,G,Y,M,Z)
~~~

### Batched_DLEQ_Verify

~~~
Input:

 G: Public generator of group GG.
 Y: Signer public key.
 [Mi]: An array of points in GG of length n.
 [Zi]: An array of points in GG of length n.
 D: DLEQ proof (c, s).

Output:

 True if log_G(Y) == log_(Mi)(Zi) for each i in 1...n, False otherwise.

Steps:

 1. seed <- H_4(G,Y,[Mi,Zi]))
 2. d1,...dn <- PRNG(seed,salt,info,n)
 3. c1,...,cn := (int)d1,...,(int)dn
 4. M := c1M1 + ... + cnMn
 5. Z := c1Z1 + ... + cnZn
 6. Output DLEQ_Verify(G,Y,M,Z,D)
~~~

## Modified protocol execution

The VOPRF protocol from Section {{protocol}} changes to allow specifying
multiple blinded PRF inputs [Mi] for i in 1...n. Then P computes the array [Zi]
and replaces DLEQ_Generate with Batched_DLEQ_Generate over these arrays. The
same applies to the algorithm VOPRF_Sign. The same applies for replacing
DLEQ_Verify with Batched_DLEQ_Verify when V verifies the response from P and
during the algorithm VOPRF_Verify.

## PRNG and resampling

Any function that satisfies the security properties of a pseudorandom number
generator can be used for computing the batched DLEQ proof. For example,
SHAKE-256 {{SHAKE}} or HKDF-SHA256 {{RFC5869}} would be reasonable choices for
groups that have an order of 256 bits.

We note that the PRNG outputs d1,...,dn must be smaller than the order of the
group/curve that is being used. Resampling can be achieved by increasing the
value of the iterator that is used in the info field of the PRNG input.

# Supported ciphersuites {#ciphersuites}

This section specifies supported ECVOPRF group and hash function
instantiations. We only provide ciphersuites in the EC setting as these provide
the most efficient way of instantiating the OPRF. Our instantiation includes
considerations for providing the DLEQ proofs that make the instantiation a
VOPRF. To only support OPRF operations (ECOPRF) then support for the relevant
components is just dropped. In addition, we currently only support ciphersuites
demonstrating 128 bits of security.

ECVOPRF-P256-HKDF-SHA256:

- GG: SECP256K1 curve {{SEC2}}
- H_1: {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}}
  - hash-to-curve: map2curve_simple_swu
  - hash-to-base:
    - H: SHA-256
    - hbits: 256
    - label: voprf_h2c
- H_2: SHA256
- H_3: SHA256
- H_4: SHA256
- PRNG: HKDF-SHA256

ECVOPRF-RISTRETTO-HKDF-SHA256:

- GG: Ristretto {{RISTRETTO}}
- H_1: {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}}
  - hash-to-curve: map2curve_elligator2
  - hash-to-base:
    - hash: SHA256
    - hbits: 256
    - label: voprf_h2c
- H_2: SHA256
- H_3: SHA256
- H_4: SHA256
- PRNG: HKDF-SHA256

In the case of Ristretto, internal point representations are represented by
Ed25519 {{RFC7748}} points. As a result, we can use the same hash-to-curve
encoding as we would use for Ed25519 {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}}.

# Security Considerations {#sec}

Security of the protocol depends on P's secrecy of k. Best practices recommend P
regularly rotate k so as to keep its window of compromise small. Moreover, it
each key should be generated from a source of safe, cryptographic randomness.

Another critical aspect of this protocol is reliance on
{{I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}} for mapping arbitrary inputs x to points on a
curve. Security requires this mapping be pre-image and collision resistant.

## Timing Leaks

To ensure no information is leaked during protocol execution, all operations
that use secret data MUST be constant time. Operations that SHOULD be constant
time include: H_1() (hashing arbitrary strings to curves) and DLEQ_Generate().
{{I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}} describes various algorithms for constant-time
implementations of H_1.

## Hashing to curves

We choose different encodings in relation to the elliptic curve that is used,
all methods are illuminated precisely in {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}}. In
summary, we use the simplified Shallue-Woestijne-Ulas algorithm for hashing
binary strings to the P-256 curve; the Icart algorithm for hashing binary
strings to P384; the Elligator2 algorithm for hashing binary strings to
CURVE25519 and CURVE448.

## Verifiability (key consistency)

DLEQ proofs are essential to the protocol to allow V to check that P's
designated private key was used in the computation. A side effect of this
property is that it prevents P from using a unique key for select verifiers as
a way of "tagging" them. If all verifiers expect use of a certain private key,
e.g., by locating P's public key published from a trusted registry, then P
cannot present unique keys to an individual verifier.

For this side effect to hold, P must also be prevented from using other 
unblinding techniques that can be achieved via manipulation of P's public key 
within a trusted registry. For example, if P is able to rotate P's published 
public key at short time intervals, P may be able to assign a likely identity 
to V based on the public key used. Similarly, if P can publish N public keys 
to a trusted registry then P may be able to control presentation of these keys
in such a way that V is retroactively identified by V's key choice across 
multiple requests.

# Applications {#apps}

This section describes various applications of the VOPRF protocol.

## Privacy Pass

This VOPRF protocol is used by Privacy Pass system to help Tor users bypass
CAPTCHA challenges. Their system works as follows. Client C connects -- through
Tor -- to an edge server E serving content. Upon receipt, E serves a CAPTCHA to
C, who then solves the CAPTCHA and supplies, in response, n blinded points. E
verifies the CAPTCHA response and, if valid, signs (at most) n blinded points,
which are then returned to C along with a batched DLEQ proof. C stores the
tokens if the batched proof verifies correctly. When C attempts to connect to E
again and is prompted with a CAPTCHA, C uses one of the unblinded and signed
points, or tokens, to derive a shared symmetric key sk used to MAC the CAPTCHA
challenge. C sends the CAPTCHA, MAC, and token input x to E, who can use x to
derive sk and verify the CAPTCHA MAC. Thus, each token is used at most once by
the system.

The Privacy Pass implementation uses the P-256 instantiation of the VOPRF
protocol. For more details, see {{DGSTV18}}.

## Private Password Checker

In this application, let D be a collection of plaintext passwords obtained by
prover P. For each password p in D, P computes VOPRF_Sign(H_1(p)), where H_1 is
as described above, and stores the result in a separate collection D'. P then
publishes D' with Y, its public key. If a client C wishes to query D' for a
password p', it runs the VOPRF protocol using p as input x to obtain output y.
By construction, y will be the signature of p hashed onto the curve. C can then
search D' for y to determine if there is a match.

Examples of such password checkers already exist, for example: {{JKKX16}},
{{JKK14}} and {{SJKS17}}.

### Parameter Commitments

For some applications, it may be desirable for P to bind tokens to certain
parameters, e.g., protocol versions, ciphersuites, etc. To accomplish this, P
should use a distinct scalar for each parameter combination. Upon redemption of
a token T from V, P can later verify that T was generated using the scalar
associated with the corresponding parameters.
