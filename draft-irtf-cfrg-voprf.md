--- abstract

An Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) is a two-party protocol for
computing the output of a PRF. One party (the server) holds the PRF
secret key, and the other (the client) holds the PRF input. The
'obliviousness' property ensures that the server does not learn anything
about the client's input during the evaluation. The client should also
not learn anything about the server's secret PRF key. Optionally, OPRFs
can also satisfy a notion 'verifiability' (VOPRF). In this setting, the
client can verify that the server's output is indeed the result of
evaluating the underlying PRF with just a public key. This document
specifies OPRF and VOPRF constructions instantiated within prime-order
groups, including elliptic curves.

# Introduction

A pseudorandom function (PRF) F(k, x) is an efficiently computable
function taking a private key k and a value x as input. This function is
pseudorandom if the keyed function K(\_) = F(K, \_) is indistinguishable
from a randomly sampled function acting on the same domain and range as
K(). An oblivious PRF (OPRF) is a two-party protocol between a server
and a client, where the server holds a PRF key k and the client holds
some input x. The protocol allows both parties to cooperate in computing
F(k, x) such that: the client learns F(k, x) without learning anything
about k; and the server does not learn anything about x or F(k, x).
A Verifiable OPRF (VOPRF) is an OPRF wherein the server can prove to the
client that F(k, x) was computed using the key k.

The usage of OPRFs has been demonstrated in constructing a number of
applications: password-protected secret sharing schemes {{JKKX16}};
privacy-preserving password stores {{SJKS17}}; and
password-authenticated key exchange or PAKE {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-opaque}}. A VOPRF is
necessary in some applications, e.g., the Privacy Pass protocol
{{!I-D.davidson-pp-protocol}}, wherein this VOPRF is used to generate
one-time authentication tokens to bypass CAPTCHA challenges. VOPRFs have
also been used for password-protected secret sharing schemes e.g.
{{JKK14}}.

This document introduces an OPRF protocol built in prime-order groups,
applying to finite fields of prime-order and also elliptic curve (EC)
groups. The protocol has the option of being extended to a VOPRF with
the addition of a NIZK proof for proving discrete log equality
relations. This proof demonstrates correctness of the computation, using
a known public key that serves as a commitment to the server's secret
key. The document describes the protocol, the public-facing API, and its
security properties.

## Requirements

{::boilerplate bcp14}

# Preliminaries

The (V)OPRF protocol in this document has two primary dependencies:

- `GG`: A prime-order group implementing the API described below in {{pog}},
  with base point defined in the corresponding reference for each group.
  (See {{ciphersuites}} for these base points.)
- `Hash`: A cryptographic hash function that is indifferentiable from a
  Random Oracle, whose output length is Nh bytes long.

{{ciphersuites}} specifies ciphersuites as combinations of `GG` and `Hash`.

## Prime-Order Group Dependency {#pog}

In this document, we assume the construction of an additive, prime-order
group `GG` for performing all mathematical operations. Such groups are
uniquely determined by the choice of the prime `p` that defines the
order of the group. We use `GF(p)` to represent the finite field of
order `p`. For the purpose of understanding and implementing this
document, we take `GF(p)` to be equal to the set of integers defined by
`{0, 1, ..., p-1}`.

The fundamental group operation is addition `+` with identity element
`I`. For any elements `A` and `B` of the group `GG`, `A + B = B + A` is
also a member of `GG`. Also, for any `A` in `GG`, there exists an element
`-A` such that `A + (-A) = (-A) + A = I`. Scalar multiplication is
equivalent to the repeated application of the group operation on an
element A with itself `r-1` times, this is denoted as `r*A = A + ... + A`.
For any element `A`, `p*A=I`. We denote `G` as the fixed generator of
the group. Scalar base multiplication is equivalent to the repeated
application of the group operation `G` with itself `r-1` times, this
is denoted as `ScalarBaseMult(r)`. The set of scalars corresponds to
`GF(p)`. This document uses types `Element` and `Scalar` to denote elements
of the group `GG` and its set of scalars, respectively.

We now detail a number of member functions that can be invoked on a
prime-order group `GG`.

- Order(): Outputs the order of `GG` (i.e. `p`).
- Identity(): Outputs the identity element of the group (i.e. `I`).
- HashToGroup(x): A member function of `GG` that deterministically maps
  an array of bytes `x` to an element of `GG`. The map must ensure that,
  for any adversary receiving `R = HashToGroup(x)`, it is
  computationally difficult to reverse the mapping. This function is optionally
  parameterized by a domain separation tag (DST); see {{ciphersuites}}.
- HashToScalar(x): A member function of `GG` that deterministically maps
  an array of bytes `x` to an element in GF(p). This function is optionally
  parameterized by a DST; see {{ciphersuites}}.
- RandomScalar(): A member function of `GG` that chooses at random a
  non-zero element in GF(p).
- SerializeElement(A): A member function of `GG` that maps a group element `A`
  to a unique byte array `buf` of fixed length `Ne`. The output type of
  this function is `SerializedElement`.
- DeserializeElement(buf): A member function of `GG` that maps a byte array
  `buf` to a group element `A`, or fails if the input is not a valid
  byte representation of an element. This function can raise a
  DeserializeError if deserialization fails or `A` is the identity element
  of the group; see {{input-validation}}.
- SerializeScalar(s): A member function of `GG` that maps a scalar element `s`
  to a unique byte array `buf` of fixed length `Ns`. The output type of this
  function is `SerializedScalar`.
- DeserializeScalar(buf): A member function of `GG` that maps a byte array
  `buf` to a scalar `s`, or fails if the input is not a valid byte
  representation of a scalar. This function can raise a
  DeserializeError if deserialization fails; see {{input-validation}}.

Two functions can be used for generating a (V)OPRF key pair (`skS`, `pkS`)
where `skS` is a non-zero integer less than `p` and `pkS = ScalarBaseMult(skS)`:
`GenerateKeyPair` and `DeriveKeyPair`. `GenerateKeyPair` is a randomized function
that outputs a fresh key pair (`skS`, `pkS`) upon ever invocation. `DeriveKeyPair`
is a  deterministic  function that generates private key `skS` from a random byte
string `seed`, which SHOULD have at least `Ns` bytes of entropy, and then
computes `pkS = ScalarBaseMult(skS)`.

It is convenient in cryptographic applications to instantiate such
prime-order groups using elliptic curves, such as those detailed in
{{SEC2}}. For some choices of elliptic curves (e.g. those detailed in
{{RFC7748}}, which require accounting for cofactors) there are some
implementation issues that introduce inherent discrepancies between
standard prime-order groups and the elliptic curve instantiation. In
this document, all algorithms that we detail assume that the group is a
prime-order group, and this MUST be upheld by any implementation. That is,
any curve instantiation should be written such that any discrepancies
with a prime-order group instantiation are removed. See {{ciphersuites}}
for advice corresponding to the implementation of this interface for
specific definitions of elliptic curves.

## Conventions and Terminology

The following conventions are used throughout the document.

- For any object `x`, we write `len(x)` to denote its length in bytes.
- For two byte arrays `x` and `y`, write `x || y` to denote their
  concatenation.
- I2OSP and OS2IP: Convert a byte array to and from a non-negative
  integer as described in {{!RFC8017}}. Note that these functions
  operate on byte arrays in big-endian byte order.

Data structure descriptions use TLS notation {{RFC8446, Section 3}}.

All algorithm descriptions are written in a Python-like pseudocode.
We also use the `CT_EQUAL(a, b)` function to represent constant-time
byte-wise equality between byte arrays `a` and `b`. This function
returns `true` if `a` and `b` are equal, and `false` otherwise.

The following terms are used throughout this document.

- PRF: Pseudorandom Function.
- OPRF: Oblivious Pseudorandom Function.
- VOPRF: Verifiable Oblivious Pseudorandom Function.
- Client: Protocol initiator. Learns pseudorandom function evaluation as
  the output of the protocol.
- Server: Computes the pseudorandom function over a secret key. Learns
  nothing about the client's input.
- NIZK: Non-interactive zero knowledge.
- DLEQ: Discrete Logarithm Equality.

# (V)OPRF Protocol {#protocol}

In this section, we define two OPRF variants: a base mode and verifiable
mode. In the base mode, a client and server interact to compute y =
F(skS, x), where x is the client's input, skS is the server's private
key, and y is the OPRF output. The client learns y and the server learns
nothing. In the verifiable mode, the client also gets proof that the
server used skS in computing the function.

To achieve verifiability, as in the original work of {{JKK14}}, we
provide a zero-knowledge proof that the key provided as input by the
server in the `Evaluate` function is the same key as it used to produce
their public key. As an example of the nature of attacks that this
prevents, this ensures that the server uses the same private key for
computing the VOPRF output and does not attempt to "tag" individual
servers with select keys. This proof must not reveal the server's
long-term private key to the client.

The following one-byte values distinguish between these two modes:

| Mode           | Value |
|:===============|:======|
| modeBase       | 0x00  |
| modeVerifiable | 0x01  |

## Overview {#protocol-overview}

Both participants agree on the mode and a choice of ciphersuite that is
used before the protocol exchange. Once established, the base mode of
the protocol runs to compute `output = F(skS, input)` as follows:

~~~
     Client(input)                             Server(skS)
  ----------------------------------------------------------
    blind, blindedElement = Blind(input)

                       blindedElement
                        ---------->

    evaluatedElement, proof = Evaluate(skS, blindedElement)

                      evaluatedElement
                        <----------

    output = Finalize(input, blind, evaluatedElement, blindedElement)
~~~

In `Blind` the client generates a token and blinding data. The server
computes the (V)OPRF evaluation in `Evaluation` over the client's
blinded token. In `Finalize` the client unblinds the server response
and produces a byte array corresponding to the output of the OPRF protocol.

In the verifiable mode of the protocol, the server additionally computes
a proof in Evaluate. The client verifies this proof using the server's
expected public key before completing the protocol and producing the
protocol output.

## Context Setup

Both modes of the OPRF involve an offline setup phase. In this phase,
both the client and server create a context used for executing the
online phase of the protocol. The key pair (`skS`, `pkS`) should be
generated by calling either `GenerateKeyPair` or `DeriveKeyPair`.

The base mode setup functions for creating client and server contexts are below:

~~~
def SetupBaseServer(suite, skS):
  contextString =
    "VOPRF07-" || I2OSP(modeBase, 1) || I2OSP(suite.ID, 2)
  return ServerContext(contextString, skS)

def SetupBaseClient(suite):
  contextString =
    "VOPRF07-" || I2OSP(modeBase, 1) || I2OSP(suite.ID, 2)
  return ClientContext(contextString)
~~~

The verifiable mode setup functions for creating client and server
contexts are below:

~~~
def SetupVerifiableServer(suite, skS, pkS):
  contextString =
    "VOPRF07-" || I2OSP(modeVerifiable, 1) || I2OSP(suite.ID, 2)
  return VerifiableServerContext(contextString, skS)

def SetupVerifiableClient(suite, pkS):
  contextString =
    "VOPRF07-" || I2OSP(modeVerifiable, 1) || I2OSP(suite.ID, 2)
  return VerifiableClientContext(contextString, pkS)
~~~

Each setup function takes a ciphersuite from the list defined in
{{ciphersuites}}. Each ciphersuite has a two-byte field ID used to
identify the suite.

[[RFC editor: please change "VOPRF07" to "RFCXXXX", where XXXX is the final number, here and elsewhere before publication.]]

## Context APIs {#api}

In this section, we detail the APIs available on the client and server
(V)OPRF contexts. Each API has the following implicit parameters:

- GG, a prime-order group implementing the API described in {{pog}}.
- contextString, a domain separation tag taken from the client or server
  context.

The data type `ClientInput` is an opaque byte string of arbitrary length
no larger than 2^13 octets. `Proof` is a concatenated sequence of two
`SerializedScalar` values, as shown below.

~~~
SerializedScalar Proof[2*Ns];
~~~

### Server Context

The ServerContext encapsulates the context string constructed during
setup and the (V)OPRF key pair. It has three functions, `Evaluate`,
`FullEvaluate` and `VerifyFinalize` described below. `Evaluate` takes
serialized representations of blinded group elements from the client as inputs.

`FullEvaluate` takes ClientInput values, and it is useful for applications
that need to compute the whole OPRF protocol on the server side only.

`VerifyFinalize` takes ClientInput values and their corresponding output
digests from `Finalize` as input, and returns true if the inputs match the outputs.

Note that `VerifyFinalize` and `FullEvaluate` are not used in the main OPRF
protocol. They are exposed as an API for building higher-level protocols.

#### Evaluate

Output:

  SerializedElement evaluatedElement

Errors: DeserializeError

def Evaluate(skS, blindedElement):
  R = GG.DeserializeElement(blindedElement)
  Z = skS * R
  evaluatedElement = GG.SerializeElement(Z)

  return evaluatedElement
~~~

#### FullEvaluate

              I2OSP(len(issuedElement), 2) || issuedElement ||
              I2OSP(len(finalizeDST), 2) || finalizeDST

              I2OSP(len(finalizeDST), 2) || finalizeDST

  digest = Hash(hashInput)

  return CT_EQUAL(digest, output)
~~~

### VerifiableServerContext

The VerifiableServerContext extends the base ServerContext with an
augmented `Evaluate()` function. This function produces a proof that
`skS` was used in computing the result. It makes use of the helper
functions `GenerateProof` and `ComputeComposites`, described below.

#### Evaluate

  Scalar skS
  Element pkS
  SerializedElement blindedElement

Output:

  SerializedElement evaluatedElement

  Z = skS * R
  evaluatedElement = GG.SerializeElement(Z)

  proof = GenerateProof(skS, G, pkS, R, Z)

  return evaluatedElement, proof
~~~

The helper functions `GenerateProof` and `ComputeComposites` are defined
below.

#### GenerateProof

  Scalar k
  Element A
  Element B
  Element C
  Element D

            I2OSP(len(challengeDST), 2) || challengeDST

  c = GG.HashToScalar(h2Input)
  s = (r - c * k) mod p
  proof = [GG.SerializeScalar(c), GG.SerializeScalar(s)]

  return proof
~~~

##### Batching inputs

Unlike other functions, `ComputeComposites` takes lists of inputs,
rather than a single input. Applications can take advantage of this
functionality by invoking `GenerateProof` on batches of inputs to
produce a combined, constant-size proof. (In the pseudocode above,
the single inputs `blindedElement` and `evaluatedElement` are passed as
one-item lists to `ComputeComposites`.)

In particular, servers can produce a single, constant-sized proof for N
client inputs sent in a single request, rather than one proof per client
input. This optimization benefits clients and servers since it amortizes
the cost of proof generation and bandwidth across multiple requests.

##### Fresh Randomness

We note here that it is essential that a different `r` value is used for
every invocation. If this is not done, then this may leak `skS` as is
possible in Schnorr or (EC)DSA scenarios where fresh randomness is not
used.

#### ComputeComposites

The definition of `ComputeComposites` is given below. This function is
used both on generation and verification of the proof.

~~~
Input:

  Element B
  Element Cs[m]
  Element Ds[m]

Output:

  Element composites[2]

def ComputeComposites(B, Cs, Ds):
  Bm = GG.SerializeElement(B)
  seedDST = "Seed-" || contextString
  compositeDST = "Composite-" || contextString

  h1Input = I2OSP(len(Bm), 2) || Bm ||
            I2OSP(len(seedDST), 2) || seedDST
  seed = Hash(h1Input)

  M = GG.Identity()
  Z = GG.Identity()
  for i = 0 to m-1:
    Ci = GG.SerializeElement(Cs[i])
    Di = GG.SerializeElement(Ds[i])
    h2Input = I2OSP(len(seed), 2) || seed || I2OSP(i, 2) ||
              I2OSP(len(Ci), 2) || Ci ||
              I2OSP(len(Di), 2) || Di ||
              I2OSP(len(compositeDST), 2) || compositeDST
    di = GG.HashToScalar(h2Input)
    M = di * Cs[i] + M
    Z = di * Ds[i] + Z

 return [M, Z]
~~~

If the private key is known, as is the case for the server, this function
can be optimized as shown in `ComputeCompositesFast` below.

~~~
Input:

  Scalar k
  Element B
  Element Cs[m]
  Element Ds[m]

Output:

  Element composites[2]

def ComputeCompositesFast(k, B, Cs, Ds):
  Bm = GG.SerializeElement(B)
  seedDST = "Seed-" || contextString
  compositeDST = "Composite-" || contextString

  h1Input = I2OSP(len(Bm), 2) || Bm ||
            I2OSP(len(seedDST), 2) || seedDST
  seed = Hash(h1Input)

  M = GG.Identity()
  for i = 0 to m-1:
    Ci = GG.SerializeElement(Cs[i])
    Di = GG.SerializeElement(Ds[i])
    h2Input = I2OSP(len(seed), 2) || seed || I2OSP(i, 2) ||
              I2OSP(len(Ci), 2) || Ci ||
              I2OSP(len(Di), 2) || Di ||
              I2OSP(len(compositeDST), 2) || compositeDST
    di = GG.HashToScalar(h2Input)
    M = di * Cs[i] + M

  Z = k * M

 return [M, Z]
~~~

### Client Context {#base-client}

The ClientContext encapsulates the context string constructed during
setup. It has two functions, `Blind()` and `Finalize()`, as described
below. It also has an internal function, `Unblind()`, which is used
by `Finalize`. The implementation of these functions varies depending
on the mode.

#### Blind

In this mode, blinding is done multiplicatively. Under certain application
circumstances, the more optimal additive blinding mechanism described in
{{verifiable-blind}} can be used. See {{blind-considerations}} for more
details.

`Blind` is implemented as follows.

~~~
Input:

  ClientInput input

Output:

  Scalar blind
  SerializedElement blindedElement

def Blind(input):
  blind = GG.RandomScalar()
  P = GG.HashToGroup(input)
  blindedElement = GG.SerializeElement(blind * P)

  return blind, blindedElement
~~~

The inverse `Unblind` is implemented as follows.

~~~
Input:

  Scalar blind
  SerializedElement evaluatedElement

Output:

  SerializedElement unblindedElement

Errors: DeserializeError

def Unblind(blind, evaluatedElement, ...):
  Z = GG.DeserializeElement(evaluatedElement)
  N = (blind^(-1)) * Z
  unblindedElement = GG.SerializeElement(N)

  return unblindedElement
~~~

#### Finalize

`Finalize` depends on the internal `Unblind` function. In this mode, `Finalize`
and does not include all inputs listed in {{protocol-overview}}. These additional
inputs are only useful for the verifiable mode, described in {{verifiable-finalize}}.

~~~
Input:

  ClientInput input
  Scalar blind
  SerializedElement evaluatedElement

Output:

  opaque output[Nh]

def Finalize(input, blind, evaluatedElement):
  unblindedElement = Unblind(blind, evaluatedElement)

  finalizeDST = "Finalize-" || contextString
  hashInput = I2OSP(len(input), 2) || input ||
              I2OSP(len(unblindedElement), 2) || unblindedElement ||
              I2OSP(len(finalizeDST), 2) || finalizeDST
  return Hash(hashInput)
~~~

### VerifiableClientContext {#verifiable-client}

The VerifiableClientContext extends the base ClientContext with the
desired server public key `pkS` with an augmented `Unblind()` function.
This function verifies an evaluation proof using `pkS`. It makes use of
the helper function `ComputeComposites` described above. It has one
helper function, `VerifyProof()`, defined below.

#### VerifyProof

This algorithm outputs a boolean `verified` which indicates whether the
proof inside of the evaluation verifies correctly, or not.

~~~
Input:

  Element A
  Element B
  Element C
  Element D
  Proof proof

Output:

  boolean verified

def VerifyProof(A, B, C, D, proof):
  Cs = [C]
  Ds = [D]

  a = ComputeComposites(B, Cs, Ds)
  c = GG.DeserializeScalar(proof[0])
  s = GG.DeserializeScalar(proof[1])

  M = a[0]
  Z = a[1]
  t2 = ((s * A) + (c * B))
  t3 = ((s * M) + (c * Z))

  Bm = GG.SerializeElement(B)
  a0 = GG.SerializeElement(M)
  a1 = GG.SerializeElement(Z)
  a2 = GG.SerializeElement(t2)
  a3 = GG.SerializeElement(t3)

  challengeDST = "Challenge-" || contextString
  h2Input = I2OSP(len(Bm), 2) || Bm ||
            I2OSP(len(a0), 2) || a0 ||
            I2OSP(len(a1), 2) || a1 ||
            I2OSP(len(a2), 2) || a2 ||
            I2OSP(len(a3), 2) || a3 ||
            I2OSP(len(challengeDST), 2) || challengeDST

  expectedC  = GG.HashToScalar(h2Input)

  return CT_EQUAL(expectedC, c)
~~~

#### Verifiable Blind {#verifiable-blind}

In this mode, where the server public key is available for proof verification,
blinding is done additively. This variant is named `VerifiableBlind` and
`VerifiableUnblind`. It takes two inputs: the client input and a blinded
version of the group generator. The latter is computed using a function called
`VerifiablePreprocess`, also described below.

`VerifiableBlind` is implemented as follows.

~~~
Input:

  ClientInput input
  Element blindedGenerator

Output:

  SerializedElement blindedElement

def VerifiableBlind(input, blindedGenerator):
  P = GG.HashToGroup(input)
  blindedElement = GG.SerializeElement(P + blindedGenerator)

  return blindedElement
~~~

The inverse `VerifiableUnblind` is implemented as follows. This function
can raise an exception if element deserialization or proof verification
fails.

~~~
Input:

  Element blindedPublicKey
  SerializedElement evaluatedElement
  SerializedElement blindedElement
  Element pkS
  Scalar proof

Output:

  SerializedElement unblindedElement

Errors: DeserializeError, VerifyError

def VerifiableUnblind(blindedPublicKey, evaluatedElement,
                      blindedElement, pkS, proof):
  Z = GG.DeserializeElement(evaluatedElement)
  R = GG.DeserializeElement(blindedElement)
  if VerifyProof(G, pkS, R, Z, proof) == false:
    raise VerifyError

  N := Z - blindedPublicKey
  unblindedElement = GG.SerializeElement(N)

  return unblindedElement
~~~

The internal `VerifiablePreprocess` function computes a blind and uses it to
compute a corresponding blinded version of the group generator and server
public key. This function can be used to pre-compute tables of values for
future invocations of the protocol, or it can be computed only when needed
for a single invocation of the protocol.

~~~
Input:

  Element pkS

Output:

  Element blindedGenerator
  Element blindedPublicKey
  Scalar blind

def Preprocess(pkS):
  blind = GG.RandomScalar()
  blindedGenerator = ScalarBaseMult(blind)
  blindedPublicKey = pkS * blind

  return blindedGenerator, blindedPublicKey, blind
~~~

#### Verifiable Finalize {#verifiable-finalize}

~~~
Input:

  ClientInput input
  Element blindedPublicKey
  SerializedElement evaluatedElement
  SerializedElement blindedElement
  Element pkS
  Scalar proof

Output:

  opaque output[Nh]

def Finalize(input, blindedPublicKey, evaluatedElement,
             blindedElement, pkS, proof):
  unblindedElement =
    VerifiableUnblind(blindedPublicKey, evaluatedElement,
                      blindedElement, pkS, proof)

  finalizeDST = "Finalize-" || contextString
  hashInput = I2OSP(len(input), 2) || input ||
              I2OSP(len(unblindedElement), 2) || unblindedElement ||
              I2OSP(len(finalizeDST), 2) || finalizeDST
  return Hash(hashInput)
~~~

# Ciphersuites {#ciphersuites}

A ciphersuite (also referred to as 'suite' in this document) for the protocol
wraps the functionality required for the protocol to take place. This
ciphersuite should be available to both the client and server, and agreement
on the specific instantiation is assumed throughout. A ciphersuite contains
instantiations of the following functionalities:

- `GG`: A prime-order group exposing the API detailed in {{pog}}, with base
  point defined in the corresponding reference for each group. Each group also
  specifies HashToGroup, HashToScalar, and serialization functionalities. For
  HashToGroup, the domain separation tag (DST) is constructed in accordance
  with the recommendations in {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}}, Section 3.1.
  For HashToScalar, each group specifies an integer order that is used in
  reducing integer values to a member of the corresponding scalar field.
- `Hash`: A cryptographic hash function that is indifferentiable from a
  Random Oracle, whose output length is Nh bytes long.

This section specifies ciphersuites with supported groups and hash functions.
For each ciphersuite, contextString is that which is computed in the Setup
functions.

Applications should take caution in using ciphersuites targeting P-256
and ristretto255. See {{cryptanalysis}} for related discussion.

# API Considerations {#apis}

Some VOPRF APIs specified in this document are fallible. For example, `Finalize`
and `Evaluate` can fail if any element received from the peer fails deserialization.
The explicit errors generated throughout this specification, along with the
conditions that lead to each error, are as follows:

- `VerifyError`: VOPRF proof verification failed; {{verifiable-blind}}.
- `DeserializeError`: Group element or scalar deserialization failure; {{pog}}.

The errors in this document are meant as a guide to implementors. They are not
an exhaustive list of all the errors an implementation might emit. For example,
implementations might run out of memory and return a corresponding error.

# Security Considerations {#sec}

This section discusses the cryptographic security of our protocol, along
with some suggestions and trade-offs that arise from the implementation
of an OPRF.

## Security Properties {#properties}

The security properties of an OPRF protocol with functionality y = F(k,
x) include those of a standard PRF. Specifically:

- Pseudorandomness: F is pseudorandom if the output y = F(k,x) on any
  input x is indistinguishable from uniformly sampling any element in
  F's range, for a random sampling of k.

In other words, consider an adversary that picks inputs x from the
domain of F and evaluates F on (k,x) (without knowledge of randomly
sampled k). Then the output distribution F(k,x) is indistinguishable
from the output distribution of a randomly chosen function with the same
domain and range.

A consequence of showing that a function is pseudorandom, is that it is
necessarily non-malleable (i.e. we cannot compute a new evaluation of F
from an existing evaluation). A genuinely random function will be
non-malleable with high probability, and so a pseudorandom function must
be non-malleable to maintain indistinguishability.

An OPRF protocol must also satisfy the following property:

- Oblivious: The server must learn nothing about the client's input or
  the output of the function. In addition, the client must learn nothing
  about the server's private key.

Essentially, obliviousness tells us that, even if the server learns the
client's input x at some point in the future, then the server will not
be able to link any particular OPRF evaluation to x. This property is
also known as unlinkability {{DGSTV18}}.

Optionally, for any protocol that satisfies the above properties, there
is an additional security property:

- Verifiable: The client must only complete execution of the protocol if
  it can successfully assert that the OPRF output it computes is
  correct. This is taken with respect to the OPRF key held by the
  server.

Any OPRF that satisfies the 'verifiable' security property is known as a
verifiable OPRF, or VOPRF for short. In practice, the notion of
verifiability requires that the server commits to the key before the
actual protocol execution takes place. Then the client verifies that the
server has used the key in the protocol using this commitment. In the
following, we may also refer to this commitment as a public key.

## Cryptographic Security {#cryptanalysis}

Below, we discuss the cryptographic security of the (V)OPRF protocol
from {{protocol}}, relative to the necessary cryptographic assumptions
that need to be made.

### Computational Hardness Assumptions {#assumptions}

Each assumption states that the problems specified below are
computationally difficult to solve in relation to a particular choice of
security parameter `sp`.

Let GG = GG(sp) be a group with prime-order p, and let GF(p) be a finite
field of order p.

#### Discrete-log (DL) Problem {#dl}

Given G, a generator of GG, and H = hG for some h in GF(p); output h.

#### Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) Problem {#ddh}

Sample uniformly at random d in {0,1}. Given (G, aG, bG, C), where

- G is a generator of GG;
- a,b are elements of GF(p);
- if d == 0: C = abG; else: C is sampled uniformly at random from GG.

Output d' == d.

### Protocol Security {#protocol-sec}

Our OPRF construction is based on the VOPRF construction known as
2HashDH-NIZK given by {{JKK14}}; essentially without providing
zero-knowledge proofs that verify that the output is correct. Our VOPRF
construction is identical to the {{JKK14}} construction, except that we
can optionally perform multiple VOPRF evaluations in one go, whilst only
constructing one NIZK proof object. This is enabled using an established
batching technique.

Consequently, the cryptographic security of our construction is based on
the assumption that the One-More Gap DH is computationally difficult to
solve.

The (N,Q)-One-More Gap DH (OMDH) problem asks the following.

~~~
    Given:
    - G, k * G, and (G_1, ... , G_N), all elements of GG;
    - oracle access to an OPRF functionality using the key k;
    - oracle access to DDH solvers.

    Find Q+1 pairs of the form below:

    (G_{j_s}, k * G_{j_s})

    where the following conditions hold:
      - s is a number between 1 and Q+1;
      - j_s is a number between 1 and N for each s;
      - Q is the number of allowed queries.
~~~

The original paper {{JKK14}} gives a security proof that the
2HashDH-NIZK construction satisfies the security guarantees of a VOPRF
protocol {{properties}} under the OMDH assumption in the universal
composability (UC) security model.

### Q-Strong-DH Oracle {#qsdh}

A side-effect of our OPRF design is that it allows instantiation of a
oracle for constructing Q-strong-DH (Q-sDH) samples. The Q-Strong-DH
problem asks the following.

~~~
    Given G1, G2, h*G2, (h^2)*G2, ..., (h^Q)*G2; for G1 and G2
    generators of GG.

    Output ( (1/(k+c))*G1, c ) where c is an element of GF(p)
~~~

The assumption that this problem is hard was first introduced in
{{BB04}}. Since then, there have been a number of cryptanalytic studies
that have reduced the security of the assumption below that implied by
the group instantiation (for example, {{BG04}} and {{Cheon06}}). In
summary, the attacks reduce the security of the group instantiation by
log\_2(Q)/2 bits. Note that the attacks only work in situations where Q
divides p-1 or p+1, where p is the order of the prime-order group used
to instantiate the OPRF.

As an example, suppose that a group instantiation is used that provides
128 bits of security against discrete log cryptanalysis. Then an
adversary with access to a Q-sDH oracle and makes Q=2^20 queries can
reduce the security of the instantiation by log\_2(2^20)/2 = 10 bits. Launching an attack would require
2^(p/2-log\_2(Q)/2) bits of memory.

Notice that it is easy to instantiate a Q-sDH oracle using the OPRF
functionality that we provide. A client can just submit sequential
queries of the form (G, k * G, (k^2)G, ..., (k^(Q-1))G), where each
query is the output of the previous interaction. This means that any
client that submits Q queries to the OPRF can use the aforementioned
attacks to reduce the security of the group instantiation by
(log\_2(Q)/2) bits.

Recall that from a malicious client's perspective, the adversary wins if
they can distinguish the OPRF interaction from a protocol that computes
the ideal functionality provided by the PRF.

### Implications for Ciphersuite Choices

The OPRF instantiations that we recommend in this document are informed
by the cryptanalytic discussion above. In particular, choosing elliptic
curves configurations that describe 128-bit group instantiations would
appear to in fact instantiate an OPRF with 128-(log\_2(Q)/2) bits of
security. Moreover, such attacks are only possible for those certain
applications where the adversary can query the OPRF directly.
In applications where such an oracle is not made available this security loss does not apply.

In most cases, it would require an informed and persistent attacker to
launch a highly expensive attack to reduce security to anything much
below 100 bits of security. We see this possibility as something that
may result in problems in the future. For applications that admit the
aforementioned oracle functionality, and that cannot tolerate discrete logarithm
security of lower than 128 bits, we recommend only implementing
ciphersuites with IDs 0x0002, 0x0004, and 0x0005.

## Domain Separation {#domain-separation}

Applications SHOULD construct input to the protocol to provide domain
separation. Any system which has multiple (V)OPRF applications should
distinguish client inputs to ensure the OPRF results are separate.
Guidance for constructing info can be found in
{{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}}; Section 3.1.

## Element and Scalar Validation {#input-validation}

The DeserializeElement function recovers a group element from an arbitrary
byte array. This function validates that the element is a proper member
of the group and is not the identity element, and returns an error if either
condition is not met.

For P-256, P-384, and P-521 ciphersuites, this function performs partial
public-key validation as defined in Section 5.6.2.3.4 of {{keyagreement}}.
This includes checking that the coordinates are in the correct range, that
the point is on the curve, and that the point is not the point at infinity.
If these checks fail, deserialization returns an error.

For ristretto255 and decaf448, elements are deserialized by invoking the Decode
function from {{RISTRETTO, Section 4.3.1}} and {{RISTRETTO, Section 5.3.1}}, respectively,
which returns false if the element is invalid. If this function returns false,
deserialization returns an error.

The DeserializeScalar function recovers a scalar field element from an arbitrary
byte array. Like DeserializeElement, this function validates that the element
is a member of the scalar field and returns an error if this condition is not met.

For P-256, P-384, and P-521 ciphersuites, this function ensures that the input,
when treated as a big-endian integer, is a value between 0 and `Order()`. For
ristretto255 and decaf448, this function ensures that the input, when treated as
a little-endian integer, is a valud between 0 and `Order()`.

## Hashing to Group

A critical requirement of implementing the prime-order group using
elliptic curves is a method to instantiate the function
`GG.HashToGroup`, that maps inputs to group elements. In the elliptic
curve setting, this deterministically maps inputs x (as byte arrays) to
uniformly chosen points on the curve.

In the security proof of the construction Hash is modeled as a random
oracle. This implies that any instantiation of `GG.HashToGroup` must be
pre-image and collision resistant. In {{ciphersuites}} we give
instantiations of this functionality based on the functions described in
{{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}}. Consequently, any OPRF implementation
must adhere to the implementation and security considerations discussed
in {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}} when instantiating the function.

## Blinding Considerations {#blind-considerations}

This document makes use of two types of blinding variants: multiplicative and
additive. The advantage of additive blinding is that it allows the client to
pre-process tables of blinded scalar multiplications for the group generator
and server public key. This can provide a computational efficiency advantage
(due to the fact that a fixed-base multiplication can be calculated faster than
a variable-base multiplication). Pre-processing also reduces the amount of
computation that needs to be done in the online exchange.

However, the choice of blinding mechanism has security implications. {{JKX21}}
analyze the security properties of both blinding mechanisms used in this
document. The results can be summarized as follows:

- Multiplicative blinding is safe for all applications.
- Additive blinding is possibly unsafe, unless one of the following conditions
  are met:
    - The client has a certified copy of the server public key (as is the case
      in the verifiable mode);
    - The client input has high entropy; and
    - The client mixes the public key into the OPRF evaluation.

To avoid security issues with the base mode, where some of the above conditions
may not be met, this specification RECOMMENDS use of multiplicative blinding.
This is because it is not known if the server public key is available or if the
client input has high entropy. Applications wherein either of these conditions
are true MAY use additive blinding.

The verifiable mode always makes use of the more efficient additive blinding variant,
as the public key is always available for verifying the proof.

## Timing Leaks

To ensure no information is leaked during protocol execution, all
operations that use secret data MUST run in constant time. Operations that
SHOULD run in constant time include all prime-order group operations and
proof-specific operations (`GenerateProof()` and `VerifyProof()`).

## Key Rotation {#key-rotation}

Since the server's key is critical to security, the longer it is exposed
by performing (V)OPRF operations on client inputs, the longer it is
possible that the key can be compromised. For example, if the key is kept
in circulation for a long period of time, then it also allows the
clients to make enough queries to launch more powerful variants of the
Q-sDH attacks from {{qsdh}}.

To combat attacks of this nature, regular key rotation should be
employed on the server-side. A suitable key-cycle for a key used to
compute (V)OPRF evaluations would be between one week and six months.

### Parameter Commitments

For some applications, it may be desirable for the server to bind tokens to
certain parameters, e.g., protocol versions, ciphersuites, etc. To
accomplish this, the server should use a distinct scalar for each parameter
combination. Upon redemption of a token T from the client, the server can
later verify that T was generated using the scalar associated with the
corresponding parameters.

# Test Vectors

This section includes test vectors for the (V)OPRF protocol specified
in this document. For each ciphersuite specified in {{ciphersuites}},
there is a set of test vectors for the protocol when run in the base
mode and verifiable mode. Each test vector lists the batch size for
the evaluation. Each test vector value is encoded as a hexadecimal
byte string. The label for each test vector value is described below.

- "Input": The client input, an opaque byte string.
- "Blind": The blind value output by `Blind()`, a serialized `Scalar`
  of `Ns` bytes long.
- "BlindedElement": The blinded value output by `Blind()`, a serialized
  `Element` of `Ne` bytes long.
- "EvaluatedElement": The evaluated element output by `Evaluate()`,
  a serialized `Element` of `Ne` bytes long.
- "EvaluationProofC": The "c" component of the Evaluation proof (only
  listed for verifiable mode test vectors), a serialized `Scalar` of
  `Ns` bytes long.
- "EvaluationProofS": The "s" component of the Evaluation proof (only
  listed for verifiable mode test vectors), a serialized `Scalar` of
  `Ns` bytes long.
- "Output": The OPRF output, a byte string of length `Nh` bytes.

Test vectors with batch size B > 1 have inputs separated by a comma
",". Applicable test vectors will have B different values for the
"Input", "Blind", "BlindedElement", "EvaluationElement", and
"Output" fields.

Base mode uses multiplicative blinding while verifiable mode
uses additive blinding, as described in {{base-client}} and
{{verifiable-client}}, respectively.

The server key material, `pkSm` and `skSm`, are listed under the mode for
each ciphersuite. Both `pkSm` and `skSm` are the serialized values of
`pkS` and `skS`, respectively, as used in the protocol. Each key pair
is derived from a `seed`, which is listed as well, using the following
implementation of `DeriveKeyPair`:

~~~
def DeriveKeyPair(mode, suite, seed):
  skS = GG.HashToScalar(seed, DST = "HashToScalar-" || contextString)
  pkS = ScalarBaseMult(skS)
  return skS, pkS
